‣This project is a simple and interactive form validation web page built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It demonstrates how to create a clean, responsive, and user-friendly interface that validates input fields in real time. The goal of this project is to help beginners understand how to handle user input, display dynamic error messages, and prevent form submission until all required fields are correctly filled.

‣The HTML file (user.html) structures the layout of the form, which includes input fields for name, email, working status, and gender selection. The page also includes integrated Bootstrap 5 components to ensure a modern design and responsive styling. Each field is clearly labeled, with placeholders for displaying validation messages directly below the input boxes.

‣The CSS file (user.css) contains custom styles that enhance the page’s visual appeal. It defines button styles, spacing, and text alignment, and highlights validation errors in red for better visibility. The styling ensures that users can easily distinguish between valid and invalid inputs, improving the overall user experience.

‣The JavaScript file (inputjsfile.js) handles the core validation logic. Event listeners are added to each input field to check if the user has entered the required information. When a user leaves a field empty and moves away (blur event), an error message saying “Required*” appears. The same validation runs when the user clicks the Submit button, preventing submission if any required field is left blank.

Together, these three files create a lightweight and functional form validation system. It is ideal for beginners learning front-end development, DOM manipulation, and event-driven programming.

You can extend this project by adding pattern checks for email validation, password confirmation fields, or live character counters.
